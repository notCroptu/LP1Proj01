## Architecture

#### Organizations and Algorithms

Our project is organized around four main classes: Game, Board, Player, and Piece.

* Game: This class serves as the orchestrator of the game, responsible for initializing the necessary instances and managing the game loop. It begins by prompting players for their names and providing instructions on how to play and win.
* Board: An object representing the game board, storing the state of the game as well as all the Piece objects within it in two arrays: piecesLeft and board.
* Player: This class contains methods necessary for player actions and moves within the game.
* Piece: An object instantiated with an enumeration, each with its own string unicoded.

Additionally, we utilize an Enum called PiecesChar, which defines characteristics such as BigOrSmall, WhiteOrBlack, CircleOrSquare, and HoleOrNoHole within Piece objects, with an additional flag for Invalid set to -1.

The game starts by initializing a Game object and invoking its Start method, which provides instructions and gathers player names. Then, the game loop begins.

During each iteration of the game loop:

1. Calls ShowAvailable and Render to have the rendering of the current game board situation, available pieces and other helpful information like commands, symbols, and ways to win.
2. Then a Winning situation is checked for according to the last played placement in the board in the current referenced player, which is initially be set to [0,0].

3. Inside the body of the Game loop.

   * Two similar sections run for input, the first verifying for a piece input, the second for a place input, but both work the same way. Here is the first for reference:

     1. We enter a white (true).
     2. There we have an If, checking if the player's input == exit, if true, the Game loop breaks.
     3. Inside the Else If, the first player (and current referenced Player) is asked what piece to be moved.
     4. The input is then converted into either a valid PiecesChar or an Invalid PiecesChar that is saved in LastPieceInput inside the referenced Player (with the ConvertPieceInput method also inside Player).
     5. Then, that LastPieceInput is checked with CheckInput method in an if, returning true if valid and breaking the while loop, else an error message appears and the player is promoted again.

     * In the middle of these two input sections, the player being referenced is changed.

4. After, The Piece is finally placed inside the board rendering, with the method PiecePlacer, and the loop repeats.

## References
#### Ideas
* Mariana - To have 4 classes for the project and handle the window in the Game class.
* Mariana - Use an enumeration with bitwise operations to identify pieces.
* Mariana - Have an array for the board where we place the pieces and is read in a loop when we want to check if the piece is in use.
* Mariana - In the board class, create logic that prints the board.
* Mariana - Create a Player 1 object and a Player 2 object in the Game class, but reference them through a main player and a player not in use, in order to be able to switch players.
* Mariana - To have a method in pieces to use when a piece is initialized that creates a Unicode string with the characters from its PiecesChars variable chars.
* Mariana - In the start method, create logic that asks the correct player which piece they want to play and where to play it (another player), and that changes player at the end of the loop.
* Mariana - Create a method named ConvertPieceInput in the Player class to convert an input of 4 words (big/small, white/black, etc.) into an enumeration that is saved in a variable in the player LastPieceInput, or return -1 if something is wrong.
* Mariana - In the board class, create a method that receives a variable of type PieceChar in order to place this piece in your list of pieces.
* Mariana - Create a method in the board that checks if there are any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of 4 with one of the 4 characteristics, and returns true if it does.
* Mariana - In the render method, add a section to the side of the board that exemplifies the 3 methods of winning the game, using Unicode.

        ```
        // Create a list to hold your objects
        List<MyObject> objectList = new List<MyObject>();

        // Create your object
        MyObject obj1 = new MyObject("Object 1");

        ```
        int x = 10;
